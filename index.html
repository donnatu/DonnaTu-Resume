        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Business Administration at the University of California, Riverside. I hope to major in Finance and become an actuary. Prior to studying at the University of California, Riverside, I attended San Gabriel High School located in San Gabriel, California. <br><br>

        Experience: I have had previous experience working for small businesses prior to pursuing such a degree. I was an academic tutor for an after-school program at an elementary school. Here, I tutored kids that ranged from third grade to sixth grade. I mainly focused on reading comprehension and deciphering word problems for math. The kids are usually more reserved and they like to keep to themselves because a few are shy about asking for help. With this in mind, I would always offer my help every ten to twenty minutes to ensure they are on the right track. Additionally, if I see that a few of the students are struggling, I would also create my own math problems and change up the numbers so the kids could have more problems to practice. It is like how everyone says: practice makes perfect. Unfortunately, I lost my job as an academic tutor due to the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in my workplace to shut down. For this reason, I scouted out for internships in the summer. I found a job as a financial intern at an import and export company called MTL Express. I only worked there for four months but it was an impactful time. It was at MTL Express where I learned to prepare reports and analyze statistical data in order to make decisions to help the company. There, I also learned to master Microsoft Excel and practice reading reports. After the internship ended, I decided to stop looking for work because the government started giving out more money to the unemployed. Now, I am currently receiving money from EDD.<br><br>
        
        Personal Life: I was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley. I have lived here my entire life up until I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. I moved right after I finished the fourth grade. I moved due to my parents' work reasons and lived there for about a year. When I resided there, I was very fond of the place because the air conditioner was on almost every day. I had a great time living there because it was my first time living in a completely new environment. It also felt nice because it was sort of like a new start for me since I had only lived in one place my entire life. After that year, I moved back home after I finished fifth grade because my parents missed being close to family. After the four hour drive, I was finally back in my hometown. I still currently reside in my hometown as I have not moved anywhere else. Additionally, my decision to stay at home instead of dorming at Riverside is due to remote learning. It would be a waste of money since classes are all online.
